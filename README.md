# AI-Powered-Resume-Matcher
AI-Powered Resume MatcherProject OverviewThis project implements an AI-powered resume matching system that semantically matches candidate resumes to a given job description. It leverages local embeddings generated by sentence-transformers for similarity calculation and utilizes the Google Gemini API to provide natural-language explanations for why top-matching candidates are a good fit.The system is designed to act as an AI assistant for recruiters, streamlining the initial screening process by providing ranked candidates and insightful explanations.Problem StatementRecruiters often face the challenge of sifting through numerous resumes to find the best fit for a job description. This project aims to automate and enhance this process by:Semantically matching resumes to job descriptions, going beyond keyword matching.Providing a ranked list of top candidates based on their relevance.Generating clear, concise explanations for the fit, powered by Gemini, to aid in decision-making.FeaturesCandidate Data Ingestion: Reads candidate profiles from a candidates.json file.Semantic Embedding: Extracts job_title, skills, and summary from resumes and converts them into dense vector embeddings using Sentence Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2).Efficient Vector Storage: Stores candidate embeddings in a local FAISS vector index for fast similarity search.Job Description Matching: Accepts a free-text job description and finds the most similar candidates from the indexed resumes using cosine similarity.Gemini-Powered Explanations: Generates natural-language explanations for why each top candidate is a good fit for the job, using the Google Gemini 2.5 Pro API.Interactive Streamlit UI (Optional): Provides a user-friendly web interface to upload candidate data, input job descriptions, view top matches, and see AI-generated explanations.Project Structureresume-matcher/

InstallationTo set up the project locally, follow these steps:Clone the repository:git clone <your-repository-url>
cd resume-matcher
Create a virtual environment (recommended):python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
Install dependencies:The project relies on the packages listed in requirements.txt.pip install -r requirements.txt
Note on faiss-cpu: If you encounter issues installing faiss-cpu, you might need to install it from source or consider faiss-gpu if you have a CUDA-enabled GPU.API Key ConfigurationThis project uses the Google Gemini API for generating explanations.Get your API Key: Obtain a Gemini API key from the Google AI Studio.Set as Environment Variable: It's recommended to set your API key as an environment variable named GOOGLE_API_KEY.On Windows (Command Prompt):set GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
On macOS/Linux (Bash/Zsh):export GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
Alternatively, you can directly paste your API key into the GOOGLE_API_KEY variable in build_index.py, match_job.py, explain.py, and app.py files, but this is less secure for public repositories.UsageFollow these steps to use the resume matcher:1. Prepare Candidate DataPlace your candidates.json file inside the data/ directory. A sample candidates.json with 5-10 candidates should be provided.2. Build the Resume IndexRun the build_index.py script to process your candidate data, generate embeddings, and store them in the embeddings/ directory.python build_index.py
This will create embeddings/index.faiss and embeddings/metadata.pkl.3. Match a Job Description (Command Line)You can test the matching functionality directly via match_job.py. This script will take a job description as input and return top candidates.python match_job.py
# The script will prompt you to enter a job description.
Sample Output (from match_job.py):[
  {
    "id": "cand_001",
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "job_title": "Backend Engineer",
    "skills": ["Python", "Django", "PostgreSQL"],
    "score": 0.87
  },
  {
    "id": "cand_002",
    "name": "John Smith",
    "job_title": "Frontend Developer",
    "skills": ["React", "JavaScript", "CSS"],
    "score": 0.72
  }
]
4. Generate Explanations (Command Line)The explain.py script can generate a natural-language explanation for a single candidate's fit to a job description.python explain.py
# The script will prompt you to enter job description and candidate details.
5. Run the Streamlit UI (Optional)For an interactive experience, launch the Streamlit application.streamlit run app.py
This will open a web interface in your browser where you can:Upload your candidates.json file.Paste a job description.Click a button to display top matches, their scores, and Gemini-generated explanations.Bonus Features (If Implemented)Skill Overlap Visualization: See shared and missing skills between the candidate and the job description.Experience Filtering: Filter candidates based on years of experience.Similarity Score Visualization: Bar charts or tables to visualize matching scores.Export Results: Option to export matching results to CSV or PDF.Persistent Vector Database: Integration with Chroma or Weaviate for more robust storage.ContributingFeel free to fork this repository and contribute!
